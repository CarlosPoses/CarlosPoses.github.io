::: {#about-page}

<br>

I am a PhD candidate at the [Real World Evidence Team](https://research.umcutrecht.nl/research-groups/real-world-evidence-group/) at the Utrecht University Medical Center. 

My thesis focuses on the development of causal inference methods for assessing the effectiveness and safety of health interventions using health electronic records.

My supervisors are [Oisín Ryan](https://oisinryan.org) and [Linda Nab](https://github.com/LindaNab), and my promotor is [Miriam Sturkenboom](https://www.umcutrecht.nl/en/research/researchers/sturkenboom-miriam).

## About

I graduated from the [Methodology and Statistics](https://www.uu.nl/en/masters/methodology-and-statistics-behavioural-biomedical-and-social-sciences) Research Master's at Utrecht University. During my studies, I worked both as research assistant (for the ODISSEI Social Data Science Team and the `densityratio` R package) and as teaching assistant for different courses. In my Master's thesis, I developed a Bayesian implementation of the synthetic control method, a causal inference method common in the econometrics literature.

Before, I worked for three years as a researcher in survey methodology at [RECSM-UPF](https://www.upf.edu/web/survey). My main focus was measurement: estimating measurement error and assessing measurement comparability, in collaboration with the [European Social Survey](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/methodology/ess-methodology/data-quality-assessment). Check out my [publications](publications.qmd) and [CV](CV_CarlosGPoses.pdf) for details.

I have a background in social sciences, with a Bachelor's degree in [Philosophy, Politics and Economics](https://www.upf.edu/web/graus/grau-filosofia-politica-economia) from Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid and Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.

I am originally from [Galicia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galicia_(Spain)), and currently based in Utrecht.
