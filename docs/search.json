    "text": "I am a PhD candidate working in causal inference at the Real World Evidence Team, Department of Data Science & Biostatistics, UMC Utrecht.\nFor my PhD research, I evaluate and develop causal inference techniques for analyzing the safety and effectiveness of health interventions. The focus of my project is on the use of real-world evidence, essentially, health electronic records collected in routine healthcare practice."

    "text": "About\nI graduated from the Methodology and Statistics Research Master’s at Utrecht University. During my studies, I helped developing the densityratio R package, I was part of the ODISSEI Social Data Science Team, and I was a teaching assistant for different courses. My Master’s thesis focused on the development of a Bayesian implementation of the synthetic control method.\nBefore, I worked for three years as a researcher in survey methodology at RECSM-UPF. There, we used latent variable models to estimate measurement error and assess measurement comparability of data from the European Social Survey.\nOriginally from Galicia, I am now based in Utrecht."
