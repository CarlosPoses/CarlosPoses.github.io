    "text": "About\nI graduated from the Methodology and Statistics Research Master’s at Utrecht University. During my studies, I worked both as research assistant (for the ODISSEI Social Data Science Team and the densityratio R package) and as teaching assistant for different courses. In my Master’s thesis, I developed a Bayesian implementation of the synthetic control method, a causal inference method common in the econometrics literature.\nBefore, I worked for three years as a researcher in survey methodology at RECSM-UPF. My main focus was measurement: estimating measurement error and assessing measurement comparability, in collaboration with the European Social Survey. Check out my publications and CV for details.\nI have a background in social sciences, with a Bachelor’s degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics from Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid and Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.\nI am originally from Galicia, and currently based in Utrecht."
